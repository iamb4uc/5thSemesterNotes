In Java, the `StringBuffer` class is used to create and manipulate strings. It is similar to the `String` class, but it is mutable, meaning that its value can be changed after it is created.

A `StringBuffer` object can be thought of as a container for a collection of characters. You can add characters to the container, remove characters from the container, and change the order of the characters in the container.

For example, imagine that you want to create a sentence by adding words to it one at a time. You could create an empty `StringBuffer` object, then use the `append` method to add each word to the object. When you're finished, you can use the `toString` method to convert the `StringBuffer` object to a `String`.

```java
StringBuffer sentence = new StringBuffer();
sentence.append("The");
sentence.append(" ");
sentence.append("quick");
sentence.append(" ");
sentence.append("brown");
sentence.append(" ");
sentence.append("fox");

String finalSentence = sentence.toString();
```

In this example, the `StringBuffer` object `sentence` is created and words are added to the object one at a time using the `append` method. The final result is a sentence created by adding the words one by one, and then the StringBuffer object is converted to a String using the toString() method.

`StringBuffer` is generally used in situations where a large number of modifications are to be made to a string or where the performance is crucial as StringBuffer is mutable (can be modified) and thread-safe, unlike String which is immutable (cannot be modified) and not thread-safe.

In Java 11 and later versions, StringBuilder is introduced and it is similar to StringBuffer but it is not thread-safe, it's faster and it's recommended to use it over StringBuffer in single threaded environments.
