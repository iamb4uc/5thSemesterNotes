A two-dimensional array, also known as a matrix, is an array of arrays. It is a collection of elements, all of the same data type, stored in a grid-like format. Each element can be accessed using two indices, one for the row and one for the column. For example, in a two-dimensional array of integers, each element would be an integer and can be accessed using indices such as "array [2]  [4]", which would refer to the element at the third row and fifth column.
