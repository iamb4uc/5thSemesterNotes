### What is information system?
An information system is a set of computer-based tools for collecting, storing and processing of data in our world.

Businesses and other organizations rely on Information System to: 

1. Carry out and manage other operations.
2. Interact with their customers and suppliers.
3. Compete in the market place.

For example:
1. Corporation use Information systems to:
	1. reach-out to their potential customers through targeted advertisements, messages over the web.
	2. process financial accounts.
	3. manage their workforce and inventory.
 2. Government use Information systems to:
	 1. provide services to their citizens.
	 2. manage the economy.
	 3. to collect taxes.

Digital goods such as electronic books and software and online services such as e-businesses, e-commerce, and social media are all provided and operated by an information system. A typical information system uses a database to store its data and often these proves have an user interface, where we the users issue commands and can see the results.

Information systems plays a huge rule in all the aspects of our life in our constantly connected digital world.

#### [[Types of information System]]:
1. Transaction Processing System
2. Management Information System
3. Decision Support System
4. Expert System

### Write a short note on Decision support system.

It's easy to understand all four types, B2B is business to business, B2C is business to customer, C2B is customer to business and C2C is customer to customer. Each type of e-commerce is designed to serve a specific need or purpose, and businesses can choose the type that best suits their needs.



### What Does Site License Mean?

A site license is a type of software license that allows a certain number of users within a specific location or organization to use a particular software program. Site licenses are usually sold to businesses, schools, and other organizations that have multiple users who need to access the software.

A site license is typically based on a one-time payment, which gives the organization or location the right to use the software on an unlimited number of computers. This is in contrast to individual licenses, which are sold to individual users and typically require a separate payment for each user.

With a site license, the organization or location can install the software on all of its computers, and users can access the software without having to purchase individual licenses. This can be a cost-effective option for organizations with many users, as it eliminates the need to purchase multiple individual licenses.

However, it is important to note that site licenses usually come with specific terms and conditions, such as the number of users allowed and the specific location or organization that the license applies to. It's also important to note that Site licenses are usually non-transferable, meaning that the license can't be used by different organization or location.

In summary, a site license is a type of software license that allows a certain number of users within a specific location or organization to use a particular software program, it's cost-effective and can be used by an unlimited number of users.

#### What does network multi-license mean?
A network multi-license is a type of software license that allows multiple users within a network or organization to access and use a particular software program. It's based on a one-time payment, which gives the organization the right to use the software on a certain number of computers within the network, it's cost-effective and eliminates the need to purchase multiple individual licenses. However, it usually comes with specific terms and conditions, such as the number of users allowed and the specific network or organization that the license applies to.

#### What Does Public Domain Software Mean?
Public domain software refers to software that is not protected by copyright and is available for free use, modification, and distribution. This means that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute the software without any legal or financial constraints. Public domain software is often created and released by individuals, organizations, or government agencies, who choose to relinquish their rights to the software and make it freely available to the public.

### Major Components of IT management

### Managing IT



### Security and ethical challenges of IT

#### Security threat
A security threat is a malicious act that aims to corrupt or steal data or disrupt an organization’s systems or the entire organization. Information Systems are very much prone to security faults which when in hands of cyber criminals can lead to identity theft, theft of equipment or information, information extortion and many more.

- Threats are basically system vulnerability that negatively effect objects of interests.
- Due to lack of maintenance in a commercial environment or untrained professionals, software are prone to malware attacks.

#### Ethical issues in IT
- Misuse of personal information.
- Misinformation and deep-fakes.
- Lack of oversight and Acceptance of responsibility.
- Autonomous technology.
- Moral use of data and resources.
- Responsible adaptation of disruptive technologies.

#### Security measures
##### Data Backup
The most critical type of data security measure. It is done by copying or archiving data files. As a result, you can retrieve data in case of a data loss event.

##### Firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an un-trusted network, such as the Internet.

##### Encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plain-text, into an alternative form known as cipher-text. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a cipher-text back to plain-text and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

##### Security codes
These are pre-assigned/generated codes that helps authenticate authorized personals

![[Pasted image 20230115164253.png]]


### Digital Signatures

It is an electronic, encrypted, stamp of authentication on digital information such as email, macros, electronic documents, etc. It confirms that the information originated from the signer and has not been altered.

![[key.png]]

#### Advantages of digital signatures
1. Provides better security. Unauthorized person cannot do fraudulence in transactions.
2. Helps you track the status of the documents on which the digital signature is applied.
3. Businesses no longer have to wait for paper documents to be sent by courier. Contracts are easily written, completed, and signed by all concerned parties in a little amount of time no matter how far the parties are geographically.
4. Signing an electronic document digitally identifies you as the signatory and that cannot be later denied.
5. No one else can forge your digital signature or submit an electronic document falsely claiming it was signed by you.

#### Disadvantages of digital signature
1. Digital signatures, like all technological products, are highly dependent on the technology it is based on. In this era of fast technological advancements, many of these tech products have a short shelf life.
2. In order to effectively use digital signatures, both senders and recipients may have to buy digital certificates at a cost from trusted certification authorities.
3. To work with digital certificates, senders and recipients have to buy verification software at a cost.
4. In some countries, laws regarding cyber and technology-based issues are weak or even non-existent. Trading in such jurisdictions becomes very risky for those who use digitally signed electronic documents.
5. There are many different digital signature standards and most of them are incompatible with each other and this complicates the sharing of digitally signed documents.


### Privacy issues of information management systems
Privacy is an issue that concerns the computer community in connection with maintaining personal information on individual citizens in computerized record keeping systems.

Here are some of the most common issues faced by information management systems:

##### Embedding data privacy
There is a broad lack of information and understanding about embedded data, where it resides and the financial and reputational risk it posses to businesses.

##### Proliferating devices
Data privacy becomes harder to handle when you factor in things like the Internet of Things (IOT), bring-your-own-device IT policies and proliferating internet-connected tablets, phones and watches.

##### Increasing maintenance costs
Keeping your systems secure and preventing data privacy issues at the enterprise level can be expensive. But, the costs of a data breach are so significant, you need to bite the bullet and invest properly.

##### Access control is difficult in many industries
Data privacy breaches are often caused by poorly managed access within an organization. People and processes matter as much as technology. Humans are the weakest link in the chain of privacy and security.

##### Getting visibility into all of your data
Using tools to discover and classify your data is essential. This will ensure you can treat data uniquely and protect your sensitive data from any privacy issues.

##### A bad data culture
Today, keeping data for its own sake broadens the attack surface for data theft and increases the risk of breaching many data privacy laws. Forward-thinking IT teams need to balance the value of collecting, storing and processing large volumes of data against the pressing requirements for privacy, security and compliance.
