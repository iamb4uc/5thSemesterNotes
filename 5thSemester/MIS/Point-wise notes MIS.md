# E-business
Any kind of business or commercial transaction that includes sharing information across the internet. It constitutes the exchange of products and services between businesses, groups and individuals and can be seen as one of the essential activities of any business.


# E-commerce
It is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It refers to any commercial transaction that is conducted online. whether it is the sale of physical products, digital products or  services. E-commerce includes a wide range of activities such as online shopping, online banking, online ticketing, and online reservations.

It has revolutionized the way people shop and conduct business. It has made it possible for businesses to reach a global customer base, and for consumers to shop from the comfort of their own homes. E-commerce has also made it easier for businesses to track sales, customer behavior, and inventory, which has allowed them to make better decisions and improve their overall operations.

There are different types of e-commerce:  B2B (business-to-business), B2C (business-to-consumer), C2B (consumer-to-business) and C2C (consumer-to-consumer).

E-commerce has grown rapidly in recent years due to the increasing popularity of online shopping and the widespread use of mobile devices. This growth has been driven by several factors such as the availability of high-speed internet, the increasing use of mobile devices, and the growing trend of online shopping.

Overall, e-commerce has changed the way businesses operate and has made it easier for consumers to shop, pay and access services online.

## Different types of E-commerce
There are four main types of e-commerce:
1. **B2B (Business-to-Business):** This type of e-commerce involves transactions between businesses, such as a supplier selling products to a retailer.
2. **B2C (Business-to-Consumer):** This type of e-commerce involves transactions between businesses and consumers, such as a retailer selling products to a customer. This is the most common type of e-commerce and includes online shopping sites, such as Amazon or Walmart.
3. **C2B (Consumer-to-Business):** This type of e-commerce involves transactions where consumers sell products or services to businesses, such as a freelancer offering services to a company.
4. **C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer):** This type of e-commerce involves transactions between consumers, such as buying and selling items on a marketplace like eBay or Etsy.

It’s easy to understand all four types, B2B is business to business, B2C is business to customer, C2B is customer to business and C2C is customer to customer. Each type of e-commerce is designed to serve a specific need or purpose, and businesses can choose the type that best suits their needs.

# Strategic Decision Making
Strategic Decision-Making refers to identifying the best way to achieve goals and objectives. There are plans for long-term goals. It is used in competitive companies and is indented to give a company a competitive advantage by transitioning its scope and the way the company runs its activities. It also takes a lot of resources and has many uncertainties. 

# Site Licence
A site license is a type of software license that allows a certain number of users within a specific location or organization to use a particular software program. Site licenses are usually sold to businesses, schools, and other organizations that have multiple users who need to access the software.

A site license is typically based on a one-time payment, which gives the organization or location the right to use the software on an unlimited number of computers. This is in contrast to individual licenses, which are sold to individual users and typically require a separate payment for each user.

With a site license, the organization or location can install the software on all of its computers, and users can access the software without having to purchase individual licenses. This can be a cost-effective option for organizations with many users, as it eliminates the need to purchase multiple individual licenses.

However, it is important to note that site licenses usually come with specific terms and conditions, such as the number of users allowed and the specific location or organization that the license applies to. It’s also important to note that Site licenses are usually non-transferable, meaning that the license can’t be used by different
organization or location.

In summary, a site license is a type of software license that allows a certain number of users within a specific location or organization to use a particular software program, it’s cost-effective and can be used by an unlimited number of users.

## Network Multi-Licence
A network multi-license is a type of software license that allows multiple users within a network or organization to access and use a particular software program. It’s based on a one-time payment, which gives the organization the right to use the software on a certain number of computers within the network, it’s cost-effective and eliminates the need to purchase multiple individual licenses. However, it usually comes with specific terms and conditions, such as the number of users allowed and the specific network or organization that the license applies to.

## Public Domain Software
Public domain software refers to software that is not protected by copyright and is available for free use, modification, and distribution. This means that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute the software without any legal or financial constraints. Public domain software is often created and released by individuals, organizations, or government agencies, who choose to relinquish their rights to the software and make it freely available to the public.

Some examples of public domain software include:
1. Linux: a popular open-source operating system that is freely available to use, modify, and distribute.
2. Apache: an open-source web server that is widely used to host websites and web applications.
3. Python: a popular open-source programming language that is widely used for a variety of applications.
4. Gnu: a collection of open-source software tools that are widely used for a variety of applications.

Public domain software can be an attractive option for businesses, organizations, and individuals who want to use or modify software without incurring any licensing costs. However, it’s important to note that public domain software is not always supported and may not have the same level of security and reliability as commercial software.

# DBMS
In mainframe and mid-range computer systems, a DBMS is considered an important system software package that controls the development, use and maintenance of the database of computer using organisations. A DBMS programs helps organisation use their integrated collection of data records and files known as
databases.

A DBMS also simplifies the process of retrieving information from databases in the form of displays and reports. Instead of having to write computer products to extract information encloser can ask simple questions in a query language. Thus many DBMS packages provide fourth generation language and other application development feature.

## Advantages 
DBMS is a set of program that allows access, retrieval and use of that data by considering appropriate security measures. The DBMS is really useful for better data integration an its security.

Advantages of DBMS:
1. Data Integrity: A DBMS ensures data integrity by enforcing rules and constraints to prevent data inconsistencies and errors.
2. Data Security: DBMS provides security features such as user authentication and access control to protect data from unauthorized access and manipulation.
3. Data Backup and Recovery: DBMS provides the capability to backup and recover data in case of system failure or data loss.
4. Data Consistency: DBMS ensures data consistency by ensuring that data is accurate and up-to-date across different applications and users.
5. Data sharing: DBMS allows multiple users to access and manipulate data simultaneously, which improves collaboration and data sharing.
6. Data Scalability: DBMS can handle large amounts of data and can be easily scaled to accommodate growth and changing needs.
7. Improved Data Access: DBMS provides powerful query and data retrieval capabilities, which allows users to easily access and analyze data.
8. Data independence: DBMS allows users to access data in a consistent way regardless of the underlying physical structure of the data.
9. Reduced data redundancy: DBMS helps to reduce data redundancy by storing data only once and providing access to it as needed.
10. Data validation: DBMS checks the data before storing it in the database, which ensures that the data is accurate and complete.

## Application
### Customer Relationship Management
CRM database can help small business manage its customers. A CRM database organizes all the information a company has about its accounts, contacts, leads and opportunities.

### Inventory Tracking Database
It helps a retail business manage how much inventory is in a warehouse, in a storage room and on store shelves.

### Payroll and Scheduling Database
It simplifies scheduling and help prevent payroll errors. An employee database contains such fields as hourly wage, salary or commission, tax withholding rates, year-to-date income and accrued vacation time.

### Business Data Analysis
Databases make the process of analyzing data and predicting future trends easier.

# Security and ethical challenges of IT.
## Security threat
A security threat is a malicious act that aims to corrupt or steal data or disrupt an organization’s systems or the entire organization. Information Systems are very much prone to security faults which when in hands of cyber criminals can lead to identity theft, theft of equipment or information, information extortion and many more.

- Threats are basically system vulnerability that negatively effect objects of interests.
- Due to lack of maintenance in a commercial environment or untrained professionals, software are prone to malware attacks.

## Ethical issues in IT
- Misuse of personal information.
- Misinformation and deep-fakes.
- Lack of oversight and Acceptance of responsibility.
- Autonomous technology.
- Moral use of data and resources.
- Responsible adaptation of disruptive technologies.

## Security measures
### Data backup
The most critical type of data security measure. It is done by copying or archiving data files. As a result, you can retrieve data in case of a data loss event.

### Firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.

### Encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plain-text, into an alternative form known as cipher-text. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a cipher-text back to plain-text and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

### Security codes
These are pre-assigned/generated codes that helps authenticate authorized personals.

# Cyber-crime
Cyber-crime is the use of information technology for malicious activity. This can range from simply annoying computer users to huge financial loses and even the loss of human life. With increase in the digitization of modern economy and society, cyber-crime has become a regular occurrence.

## Types of cybercrime
- Identity theft.
- copyright Infringement.
- Click fraud.
- Advance fee fraud.
- Phising.
- Malware.

# Digital Signatures
It is an electronic, encrypted, stamp of authentication on digital information such as email, macros, electronic documents, etc. It confirms that the information originated from the signer and has not been altered
![[key.png]]

## Advantages
1. Provides better security. Unauthorized person cannot do fraudulence in transactions.
2. Helps you track the status of the documents on which the digital signature is applied.
3. Businesses no longer have to wait for paper documents to be sent by courier. Contracts are easily written, completed, and signed by all concerned parties in a little amount of time no matter how far the parties are geographically.
4. Signing an electronic document digitally identifies you as the signatory and that cannot be later denied.
5. No one else can forge your digital signature or submit an electronic document falsely claiming it was signed by you.

## Disadvantages
1. Digital signatures, like all technological products, are highly dependent on the technology it is based on. In this era of fast technological advancements, many of these tech products have a short shelf life.
2. In order to effectively use digital signatures, both senders and recipients may have to buy digital certificates at a cost from trusted certification authorities.
3. To work with digital certificates, senders and recipients have to buy verification software at a cost.
4. In some countries, laws regarding cyber and technology-based issues are weak or even non-existent. Trading in such jurisdictions becomes very risky for those who use digitally signed electronic documents.
5. There are many different digital signature standards and most of them are incompatible with each other and this complicates the sharing of digitally signed documents.

# Privacy issues of IMS
Privacy is an issue that concerns the computer community in connection with maintaining personal information on individual citizens in computerized record keeping systems. Here are some of the most common issues faced by information management systems:

### Embedding data privacy
There is a broad lack of information and understanding about embedded data, where it resides and the financial and reputational risk it posses to businesses.

#### Proliferating devices
Data privacy becomes harder to handle when you factor in things like the Internet of Things (IOT), bring-your-own-device IT policies and proliferating internet-connected tablets, phones and watches.

#### Increasing maintenance costs
Keeping your systems secure and preventing data privacy issues at the enterprise level can be expensive. But, the costs of a data breach are so significant, you need to bite the bullet and invest properly.

#### Access control is difficult in many industries
Data privacy breaches are often caused by poorly managed access within an organization. People and processes matter as much as technology. Humans are the weakest link in the chain of privacy and security

#### Getting visibility into all of your data
Using tools to discover and classify your data is essential. This will ensure you can treat data uniquely and protect your sensitive data from any privacy issues.

#### A bad data culture
Today, keeping data for its own sake broadens the attack surface for data theft and increases the risk of breaching many data privacy laws. Forward-thinking IT teams need to balance the value of collecting, storing and processing large volumes of data against the pressing requirements for privacy, security and compliance.

#### Ever-increasing scale of data
With hundreds of systems and millions of data records, we need a solution that can handle the scale.

# How computer crime can be prevented?
There are different major concerns about computer crime and privacy on the internet which refers to criminal conduct committed with the aid of a computer or other electronic equipment connected to the internet.

Individuals or small groups with little technical knowledge and highly organized worldwide criminal groups with relatively talented developers and specialists can engage in cyber-crime.

##### Stolen credit card information
The most common cyber-crime is when a person’s credit card information is stolen and used unlawfully to acquire or purchase goods or services over the internet.

##### Hacking government databases
Another type of cyber-crime is to tamper with sensitive government information and data.

##### Theft of user accounts
Many website carrying peoples information get breached on a regular basis nowadays. This results in extortion of user data on the dark web, and is sold to the highest bidder.

##### Compromised IoT devices
Most of the IoT devices are kept out of date with regards to their security updates, and due to the nature of these devices being connected to the internet, hackers can get unauthorized access to devices and use those devices for malicious activity.

##### Loss of control and access to content:
The Wanna-cry attack, which was allegedly launched by a state sponsored criminal organization called ‘the Lazarus’ from North-Korea, in 2017, unleashed ransomware that locked down thousands of computer mostly from the NHS(National Health Service) network, which are the government hospitals across UK. Resulting in death of patients, delay in emergency procedures and all other functions.

# How to protect our-self against cyber-crime?
#### Use strong passwords
Using a combination of alpha-numeric (abc123), special characters/symbols for a password creates a hard to crack password. These tho are hard to crack are not impossible to bypass, it just makes it difficult for anyone to just login to your account without your permission.

It is also sometimes recommended to use a pass-phrase instead of a password due to the hard to guess nature of them.

#### Regularly check of security updates
Keeping software up-to date is one of the most effective ways to protect a device against cyber-attacks, these updates usually provide patches to bugs and newly discovered exploits and attacker can use to gain access to those devices.

#### Keep most personal information off of social media
This is one of most common yet the most easiest way to find information about you is from your own social media, with all the digitization of society, every one shares every single thing about their life, with in-turn for someone seeking to harm you is a goldmine, with these information, they can do identity theft, blackmail you, or do find any required information.

To better protect against such threats, refrain from uploading everything you do in real life.

#### Secure your home network
Using a local vpn will help you encrypt your insecure plain HTTP network traffic into an HTTP connection. This will make any kind of man-in the-middle attack impossible.

#### Keep up with all major security breaches
Being aware of all the major data breaches, cyber-attacks will help you stay vigilant and let you know when you need to change your passwords that could have been breached on certain sites.
